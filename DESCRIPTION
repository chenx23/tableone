Description: Creates 'Table 1', i.e., description of baseline patient
    characteristics, which is essential in every medical research.
    Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as
    p-values and standardized mean differences. Weighted data are
    supported via the 'survey' package. New features are added to 
    the original version on CRAN to fit the RWE team's need at AstraZeneca.
